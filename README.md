## My process
I had a lot of fun working on this project. I learned so much from creating this project, including CSS flexbox and griding. After this project, I am more confident in my ability to build a responsive website. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Java
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I was able to gain valuable insight into CSS flexbox, grinding, and responsive website design thanks to this project 

### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc&t=578s) - This helped me with flexbox.
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o&t=644s) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
